What is Recursion?
 => When a function calls itself until a specified condition is met.
    And that specified condition is known as base condition.
 => It is a phenomenon when a function calls itself indefinitely until a specified condition is fulfilled.

What is base condition?
 => A particulr condition after which the loof of the function calling will terminate or stop. 
 => A recursive function can only be completed if a base condition is fulfilled

What is recursion tree?
 => A recursion tree is a visual representation of the execution flow of a recursive function.
    It helps in understanding and analyzing the recursive process by illustrating the sequence of function calls and their relationships.
 => A recursive tree is basically a representative form of recursion which depicts how functions 
    are called and returned as a series of events happening consecutively. It is a pictorial
    description of the process of recursion as illustrated below : 

              f()
              /
            f()
           /
          f()
         /
       f()

    When a recursive call gets completed, the control returns back to its parent function which is then further executed 
    until the last function waiting in the recursive stack returns.   

What is stackoverflow?
 => Whenever recursion calls are executed, theyâ€™re simultaneously stored in a recursion stack where
    they wait for the completion of the recursive function. A recursive function can only be completed
    if a base condition is fulfilled and the control returns to the parent function. 
    But, when there is no base condition given for a particular recursive function, it gets called indefinitely
    which results in a Stack Overflow i.e, exceeding the memory limit of the recursion stack and hence the program terminates giving a Segmentation Fault error.
