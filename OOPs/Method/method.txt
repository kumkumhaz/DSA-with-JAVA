JAVA METHOD:
 - Block of code performing some action which runs only when it is called.

 METHOD VS FUNCTION
  - both are similar concept

  METHODS
    indirectly we can say that function inside a class is known as method;
     - In OPPs,  a method is a function that is associated with a clas or an object.
     - it defines a behavior that the object can perform.
     - Called using .(dot) notation followed by class name
      

      public class Rectangle { --------> class name Rectangle
         private int width;
         private int height;

         public Rectangle(int width, int height) {
             this.width = width;
             this.height = height;
         }

         public int area() {  ------> method name area
             return width * height;
         }
       }

       Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(5, 10); -----> new object
       int area = rect.area(); // returns 50  -----> calling method "area" followed by class name"Rectangle"

WHY WE USE METHOD?
 - Write once , use many times
 - Time save
 - Duplicate code reduces.

TYPES OF METHODS
 1. User-Defined METHODS
    - Method created by users
    - In above example we seen that method "area()" was created by us which was user-defined method

 2. Standard library METHODS
    - Inbuilt methods in JAVA
      . String.length(): Returns the length of a string.
      . String.toLowerCase() and String.toUpperCase(): Converts a string to all lowercase or uppercase.
      . Arrays.sort(): Sorts an array of elements in ascending order.
      . Math.sqrt(): Returns the square root of a number.
      . Math.random(): Generates a random number between 0 and 1.
      . System.out.println(): Prints a string to the console.
      . Scanner.nextLine(): Reads a line of input from the console.
      . File.exists(): Returns true if a file exists.
      . ArrayList.add(): Adds an element to an ArrayList.
      . HashMap.put(): Adds a key-value pair to a HashMap.

HOW TO DECLARE METHOD

      access modifiers          return type          function/method name (   parameyters){
          |                         |                        |
    (Public, private,        (data type, void)    (anything whatever we want)
    protected, default)
     
        return (a+b);

      }

 ->   we can call above function along with the object name
      ex;
          public int area() {  ------> method name area
             return width * height;
             }
          Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(5, 10); -----> new object
             int area = rect.area();  

 ->   If we use static keyword, then we can call the function/method witout object
      ex; 
      static void welcome(){
        System.out.println("welcome to my home")
      }
      welcome();  -----> caling the function
